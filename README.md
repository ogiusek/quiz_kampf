# what i learned ?
i gained in depth understanding of:
- communication with our application:
1. we respond with dto
2. we receive request model which can be composed from business logic models

- division of app modules:
1. in which layers things should be placed
2. how wide modules should be

- communication in application:
1. how clearly structure everything clearly so calling it isn't a thing for useless discussion.

- understood how integration tests work:
integration tests are just tests of full features.
we can have integration tests programmed as white box tests but i prefer testing behaviour not implementation

- to sum up i learned how to program following best practices:
i haven't wrote everything using best practices but understood why it helps and why we should follow them and how follow them

bla bla bla
no one will read this or belive me.
i belive that i'm better programmer which is ready to program clean backend following hehe best practices.
i'm also able to create frontend but i'm not sure am i able to follow best practices.
i would need to see project.
this is what i like job for.
free learning materials with example usage in real world.
